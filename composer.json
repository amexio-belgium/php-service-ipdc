    "description": "### Access  The Product API is a public API. If you want to make use of this api, contact someone on the team to get an API key.  Each endpoint also lists the necessary permissions to call it. You can view your own permissions by calling the `/me` endpoint.   In a few cases some of the listed permissions are optional and depend upon the specific data requested.  ### Tracing  The API uses X-request-ID and X-correlation-ID headers.   Every request that hits the API without these headers, gets a new random UUID as request-ID and correlation-ID.  If you as a client pass these id's yourself, the API will use your values, but only when they are in UUID format.   If you provide a value that is not a UUID, the api will fail to handle your request.  Providing these values enables distributed request correlation & tracing.  ### Rate limiting  GET calls to this API are rate limited.   This rate limit is configured per client. You can request a higher rate limit if needed.  The rate limit uses a token bucket that is refilled within a fixed timeframe.   Each request can use multiple tokens, depending on the number of items requested.  Information about your current limit is conveyed via the response headers of each response:  | Header                | Description                                                                                                    | Example                | |-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------| | X-RateLimit-Reset     | The time at which the rate limit will reset                                                                    | 2025-07-14T15:23:45Z   | | X-RateLimit-Limit     | The maximum number of tokens to be used in the current time window                                             | 2000                   | | X-RateLimit-Remaining | The number of tokens remaining in the current time window                                                      | 670                    | | Retry-After           | Indicates how many seconds the client should wait before making a new request (only when response code is 429) | 42                     |  ### Contact",
